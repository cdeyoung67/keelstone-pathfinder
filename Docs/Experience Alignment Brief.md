# Experience Alignment Brief  
**Campaign:** 5-Day “When the Underground Calls” Series + Day 6 Keelstone Invite  
**Purpose:** Ensure the app highlights the right features and creates a cohesive, emotionally compelling experience from first email to community onboarding.

---

## 1. Campaign Overview

**Goal:**  
Introduce readers to the journey of rebellion → despair → hope → invitation, and then deliver an experience that meets (or exceeds) the expectations built over the five days.  

**Audience:**  
- **Primary:** Seekers, disillusioned professionals, those exploring meaning/faith  
- **Secondary:** Christians seeking deeper practice without church baggage  
- **Psychographic:** Feeling overwhelmed by outrage culture, seeking reflection and constructive community  

**Desired Emotional Arc:**

| Day | Emotional Goal |
|-----|----------------|
| 1 | Curiosity & recognition (“This is me”) |
| 2 | Confrontation (“This is where my anger is taking me”) |
| 3 | Sobriety (“This ends in despair if I stay here”) |
| 4 | Hope (“Maybe there’s a way back”) |
| 5 | Invitation (“I want to help build something better”) |
| 6 | Relief + Excitement (“There *is* a place for me to start”) |

## 2. Content Promise

| Day | Promise to User | Key Takeaway |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Insight into self-sabotage without judgment | “I’m not broken beyond repair.” |
| 2 | Honest look at rebellion and its limits | “Anger feels powerful, but it can’t save me.” |
| 3 | Exploration of despair and meaninglessness | “Without purpose, everything collapses.” |
| 4 | A vision for small, actionable steps | “I can take the first step — even if small.” |
| 5 | A big question inviting participation | “I want to join others asking this question.” |
| 6 | **Bonus Invite** to Keelstone | “Here is a safe place to start walking this path.” |

## 3. Experience Requirements (Feature Alignment)

The app/community must deliver on what was promised in the series and highlight those features during onboarding.

### Reflection & Journaling
- **Requirement:** Users should have an easy place to capture and share (if they want) their thoughts from Days 1–5.  
- **UX Highlight:** Show a “Your Day 6 Reflection” input right after joining to close the loop.

### Discussion Spaces
- **Requirement:** Dedicated threads/channels for each day’s theme (Underground, Rebellion, Despair, Path Back, Big Question).  
- **UX Highlight:** Automatically point new members to the Day 5 thread as the first thing they see.

### Gamification / Early Wins
- **Requirement:** Reward the act of showing up, posting, or completing the first reflection with a micro-badge or progress tracker.  
- **UX Highlight:** Show a streak indicator (“Day 6: You made it here!”).

### Onboarding Flow
- **Requirement:** Warm welcome message that mirrors the tone of Day 4–5 (“You’ve already begun the journey — now let’s take the next step together.”)  
- **UX Highlight:** Option to choose “Faith-Based Path,” “Secular Path,” or “Explore Both.”

### Moderation & Safety
- **Requirement:** Clear community guidelines promoting respect and empathy.  
- **UX Highlight:** A pinned “Welcome to the Underground Exit” post that models vulnerability.

## 4. “Wow” Moments

Design for these micro-moments to create delight:  

- **Day 6 Welcome:** Personalized welcome (“You’ve just completed the 5-day journey — here’s what’s next”).  
- **Guided First Post:** Button that says “Share your first reflection” leading to a safe, moderated space.  
- **Choice & Control:** Ability to toggle between Christian reflections and secular reflections (without judgment).  
- **Micro-Challenge:** First community challenge appears immediately (“Take one courageous step today and share it”).  
- **Recognition:** Immediate positive feedback for participation (likes, “Fruit” reactions, or badges).

> **Note:** Keelstone’s full feature set will grow beyond this initial flow, but this brief ensures the **onboarding experience highlights these specific features** so users feel that what they signed up for is being delivered — and exceeded.
